# IRCTC Ticket Confirmation Predictor

This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a train ticket will be confirmed or placed on the waitlist based on various features such as train number, WL position, quota, class, and days to journey.

## Features

- Input parameters: Train No, WL Position, Quota, Class, Days to Journey
- Predicts the status of the ticket using a trained machine learning model
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: Framework for building the web application
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for training the model
- Pandas: Data manipulation library
- joblib: For loading the trained model

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudhanshu786b/irctc_prediction_app.git
